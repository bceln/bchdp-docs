# BC ELN-BCHDP Support Service

## How can we help you?
The BC ELN - BCHDP Support Service is provided by the Arca Administrative Centre, based out of the [BC Electronic Library Network (BC ELN)](https://bceln.ca/), BC's consortium of post-secondary libraries. Our staff have years of experience helping small organizations participate in the provincial library services we run. We are leveraging this expertise to support small galleries, libraries, archives and museums (GLAM) create public access to their digitized content by placing it in Arca, BC's collaborative digital repository.

!!! list "The BC ELN-BCHDP Support Service can help you:"
    - apply for a BCHDP grant to digitize your materials
    - plan your digitization project
    - organize your digital materials and associated information/metadata for upload into Arca
    - perform batch upload of your digital materials to the Arca repository
    - customize the display of your collection (within Arca guidelines)
    - publicize your Arca collection

This support is available to BCHDP grant recipients at no cost through to 2027 thanks to a partnership between BC ELN and the Irving K. Barber Learning Centre at UBC. To provide this critical support, BC ELN draws on a pool of experienced senior staff and engages library school students and contractors from the GLAM sector.

## News
BC ELN and IKBLC initiated this partnership in 2021 to meet a shared commitment of supporting the research and learning needs of those across the province by enriching online historical collections.
