# BC ELN-BCHDP Support Service

## How can we help you?
The BC ELN - BCHDP Support Service is provided by staff at the [BC Electronic Library Network (BC ELN)](https://bceln.ca/), BC's consortium of post-secondary libraries. Our staff have years of experience helping small organizations participate in the provincial library services we run. We are leveraging this expertise to support small galleries, libraries, archives and museums (GLAMs) in providing public access to digitized content.

!!! list "The BC ELN-BCHDP Support Service can help you:"
    - apply for a BCHDP grant to digitize your materials
    - plan your digitization project
    - host your digitized materials in the [Arca provincial digital repository](https://bchdp.arcabc.ca/)
        - perform batch upload of your digitized materials to Arca    
        - customize the display of your collection (within Arca guidelines)
        - publicize your Arca collection

This support is available to BCHDP grant recipients at no cost through to 2027 thanks to a partnership between BC ELN and the Irving K. Barber Learning Centre at UBC. To provide this critical support, BC ELN draws on a pool of experienced senior staff and engages library school students and contractors from the GLAM sector.

## Participation
BC’s small libraries, archives, museums, galleries and historical associations applying for BCHDP grants are eligible to receive BC ELN support during the grant application process. Additionally, organizations can access no-cost hosting for their BCHDP-funded materials in the [Arca provincial digital repository](https://bchdp.arcabc.ca/) through the [BCHDP-Arca Hosting Initiative](https://bceln.ca/services/shared-services/bchdp-arca-hosting-initiative).
