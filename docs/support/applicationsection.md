### 5.03 Digital preservation plan
What is digital preservation?

!!! quote "*Definitions of Digital Preservation* – American Library Association, February 21, 2008 [:octicons-link-24:](http://www.ala.org/alcts/resources/preserv/defdigpres0408)"
    "Digital preservation combines policies, strategies and actions to ensure access to reformatted and born digital content regardless of the challenges of media failure and technological change. The goal of digital preservation is the accurate rendering of authenticated content over time." 

What is the difference between digitization and digitial preservation?

!!! quote "*Digital Preservation* – University at Albany University Libraries, 2021 [:octicons-link-24:](https://library.albany.edu/preservation/digipres)"
    "Digitization is the act of scanning non-digital, analog materials, to digital format. Digital preservation is the act of managing and continually strategizing to keep digital information accessible and authentic. - "Digital Preservation", University at Albany University Libraries, 2021.
