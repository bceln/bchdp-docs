# Grant Application Support

## Purpose
The BC ELN-BCHDP Support Service is a partnership between the BC Electronic Library Network (BC ELN) and the Irving K. Barber Learning Centre (IKBLC) at the University of British Columbia Library, offering vital support to prospective BC History Digitization Program (BCHDP) grant applicants seeking to bring their unique collections online. 

Depending on needs, possible support could include:

* Assistance with grant writing
* Digitization project management
* Connections to digitization service providers
* Copyright advisory
* Assistance securing digitization staff
* Metadata review

To provide this critical support, BC ELN draws on a pool of experienced senior staff and engages students enrolled in library and archives programs.

## How it works
The Early Notice Survey for each year's BCHDP cycle is typically open from July to early August. Interested parties who fill out the survey will be contacted to explore options for support in advance of the actual application cycle (Late September â€“ Early December).

The Early Notice Survey for the 2026-27 grant cycle is now open. If your organization is considering applying for a BCHDP grant in the upcoming cycle, please fill out this short Notice of Intent Survey: [https://surveys.bceln.ca/limesurvey/index.php?r=survey/index&sid=927973&lang=en](https://surveys.bceln.ca/limesurvey/index.php?r=survey/index&sid=927973&lang=en)
