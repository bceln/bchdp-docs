# Grant Application Support

## Purpose

## How it works
The Early Notice Survey for each year's BCHDP cycle is typically open from July to early August. Interested parties who fill out the survey will be contacted to explore options for support in advance of the actual application cycle (Late Septemberâ€“December).

For any inquiries outside of the July-August survey window, please email our team at `digisupport[at]bceln.ca` or call `604-368-4659`.
