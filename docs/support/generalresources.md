3. [AABC Archivist's Toolkit](https://aabc.ca/Archivist-Toolkit)
> A toolkit created by the Archives Association of British Columbia (AABC) which offers access to a wide range of online and published resources for archivists and archives workers at all levels. The toolkit aims to provide access to useful links and examples for small and medium-sized archives, no matter what stage their archival collection is in. Includes sections on "Digitization & Automation" and "Electronic Records & Digital Preservation Management."

> This manual from the AABC is written to help staff and volunteers working in small archives with limited access to training, with few employees, and with restricted finances and time. The manual explains archival principles and practices and offers guidelines and suggestions for various archival activities. The manual was originally published in 1988, with updates in 1994 and 2021.

5. [The Archivist: A DIY Book Scanner](https://makezine.com/projects/diy-book-scanner/)
> This article in Make Magazine runs through the steps of crafting a DIY book scanner. Specialty scanning equipment can be prohibitively expensive, particularly if you only have so many bound objects to scan. If you already have some cameras in place, an alternative to outsourcing digitization is creating your own cradle.
